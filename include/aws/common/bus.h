 * A message bus is a mapping of integer message types -> listeners/callbacks.
 * A listener can listen to a single message, or to all messages on a bus
 * Message types must be consecutive integers, starting at 1. 0 is reserved
 * for broadcast to all handlers.
 * Handlers will be sent a message of type 0, with a NULL payload when it is time to clean any state up.
 * Listeners are owned by the subscriber, and are no longer referenced by the bus once unsubscribed.
 * Under the AWS_BUS_ASYNC policy, message delivery happens in a separate thread from sending, so listeners are
 * responsible for their own thread safety.
